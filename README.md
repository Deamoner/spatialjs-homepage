SpatialJS is a groundbreaking framework that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital spaces. It empowers developers to create immersive Spatial Operating Applications, breaking free from traditional 2D interfaces and ushering in a new era of 3D computing environments. With SpatialJS, you're not just building applications; you're architecting new realities that seamlessly blend the digital and physical worlds, paving the way for the future of the Open Web and redefining the paradigm of human-computer interaction.
