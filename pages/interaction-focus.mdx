# Window Interaction and Focus Management

When working with multiple windows in a 3D spatial environment, it's crucial to manage interactions, focus, and selection effectively. This guide will cover the key aspects of window interaction in SpatialJS.

## 1. Window Focus

Focusing a window brings it to the forefront of the user's attention. In SpatialJS, you can manage window focus using the `useWindowStore` hook.

```typescript
import { useWindowStore } from '@spatialjs/core';

const { focus, unfocus } = useWindowStore();

// Focus a specific window
focus('window-id');

// Unfocus the currently focused window
unfocus();
```

The `focus` function automatically handles bringing the window forward in the 3D space.

## 2. Window Selection

Window selection is different from focus. It allows you to keep track of which window the user has selected for potential actions. This is managed through the `useWindowStore` hook as well.

```typescript
import { useWindowStore } from '@spatialjs/core';

const { selectedWindow, setSelectedWindow } = useWindowStore();

// Select a window
setSelectedWindow('window-id');

// Get the currently selected window
console.log(selectedWindow);
```

## 3. Interaction Events

When working with interactive elements within windows, it's important to handle events correctly. Here's an example of how to set up click events on buttons within a window:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@react-three/uikit';

const WindowContent = () => {
  const handleButtonClick = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation(); // Prevent the click from affecting the background
    // Handle the button click
  };

  return (
    <Button onClick={handleButtonClick}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
};
```

## 4. Preventing Background Interactions

To prevent interactions with the background or other windows when interacting with a specific window, you should use `stopPropagation()` on your event handlers. This is especially important for elements like the window title bar or resize handles.

Here's an example of how you might implement this in a custom window component:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { Container, Text } from '@react-three/uikit';
import { useWindowStore } from '@spatialjs/core';

const CustomWindow = ({ id, title, children }) => {
  const { focus, setSelectedWindow } = useWindowStore();

  const handleTitleBarInteraction = (e) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    focus(id);
    setSelectedWindow(id);
  };

  return (
    <Container>
      <Container onPointerDown={handleTitleBarInteraction}>
        <Text>{title}</Text>
      </Container>
      {children}
    </Container>
  );
};
```

## 5. Advanced Interaction Techniques

For more advanced interactions, SpatialJS provides several utility functions through the `useWindowStore` hook. Here are some examples:

```typescript
import { useWindowStore } from '@spatialjs/core';

const {
  setPosition,
  setScale,
  minimize,
  maximize,
  close,
  tileWindows
} = useWindowStore();

// Move a window
setPosition('window-id', new THREE.Vector3(x, y, z));

// Resize a window
setScale('window-id', new THREE.Vector3(scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ));

// Minimize a window
minimize('window-id');

// Maximize a window
maximize('window-id');

// Close a window
close('window-id');

// Tile all windows
tileWindows('grid');
```

These functions allow you to create complex interactions and window management systems within your SpatialJS application.

Remember, when implementing these interactions, always consider the user experience in a 3D spatial environment. Provide visual feedback for focus and selection, and ensure that window movements and resizing are smooth and intuitive.

For more detailed information on the WindowStore and its methods, you can refer to the WindowStore documentation:

```12:55:pages/window-store.mdx

The WindowStore interface defines the state and methods for managing windows in a 3D spatial environment:

```tsx
interface WindowStore {
  windows: Record<string, WindowInf>;
  defaultTileDistance: number;
  defaultFocusDistance: number;
  addWindow: (
    window: Omit<WindowInf, "component" | "props"> & {
      component: React.ComponentType<any>;
      props?: any;
    }
  ) => void;
  removeWindow: (id: string) => void;
  updateWindow: (id: string, updates: Partial<WindowInf>) => void;
  updateWindowProps: (id: string, props: any) => void;
  setPosition: (id: string, position: Vector3) => void;
  setScale: (id: string, scale: Vector3) => void;
  setRotation: (id: string, rotation: Euler) => void;
  minimize: (id: string) => void;
  maximize: (id: string) => void;
  focus: (id: string) => void;
  unfocus: (id: string) => void;
  close: (id: string) => void;
  tileWindows: (
    mode: "grid" | "around" | "cockpit",
    adjustScale?: boolean
  ) => void;
  resetWindowPositions: () => void;
  originalPositions: Record<string, Vector3>;
  originalScales: Record<string, Vector3>;
  updateWindowSize: (id: string, size: Vector2) => void;
  recalculateTilePositions: () => void;
  currentTileMode: "grid" | "around" | "cockpit" | null;
  camera: Camera | null;
  setCamera: (camera: Camera) => void;
  resetWindowInfrontOfCamera: () => void;
  getPointInFrontOfCamera: (distance: number) => Vector3;
  debug: boolean;
  setDebug: (value: boolean) => void;
  selectedWindow: string | undefined;
  setSelectedWindow: (id: string) => void;
}
```


This section of the documentation provides a comprehensive list of all available methods in the WindowStore, which you can use to create rich, interactive window management systems in your SpatialJS applications.
