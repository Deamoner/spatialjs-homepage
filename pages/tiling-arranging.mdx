# Window Management System

This system provides a flexible and powerful way to manage windows in a 3D environment, including tiling, focusing, and various window operations.

## Key Features

- Window creation and management
- Multiple tiling modes (grid, around, cockpit)
- Window focusing and unfocusing
- Window minimizing and maximizing
- Dynamic position and scale adjustments

## Tiling Modes

The system supports three tiling modes:

1. **Grid**: Arranges windows in a grid pattern.
2. **Around**: Positions windows in a circular arrangement.
3. **Cockpit**: Places windows in a cockpit-like configuration.

## Core Components

### WindowStore

The WindowStore is the central state management system for windows. It uses Zustand for state management and provides various methods for window manipulation.

#### Key Methods:

- `addWindow(window: WindowInf)`: Add a new window to the system.
- `removeWindow(id: string)`: Remove a window from the system.
- `tileWindows(mode: 'grid' | 'around' | 'cockpit', adjustScale?: boolean)`: Arrange windows according to the specified tiling mode.
- `focus(id: string)`: Bring a window into focus.
- `unfocus(id: string)`: Remove focus from a window.
- `minimize(id: string)`: Minimize a window.
- `maximize(id: string)`: Maximize a window.
- `close(id: string)`: Close a window.
- `resetWindowPositions()`: Reset all windows to their original positions.
