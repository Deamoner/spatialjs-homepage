# About SpatialJS

SpatialJS is a powerful library for building immersive spatial applications for the open web. Leveraging React Three Fiber (R3F), it enables developers to create fully immersive 3D experiences with ease. SpatialJS is designed to simplify the process of constructing and managing spatial user interfaces, making it an ideal toolkit for developing next-generation web applications, VR/AR experiences, and spatial computing platforms.

## Key Features

1. **Spatial Window Management**: Create and manage 3D windows in a spatial environment with intuitive controls.
2. **React Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with React components for building complex 3D user interfaces.
3. **Flexible Layouts**: Utilize various tiling modes (grid, around, cockpit) to organize your spatial windows.
4. **VR/AR Support**: Built with VR and AR experiences in mind, allowing for immersive spatial computing.
5. **Customizable Windows**: Easily customize window appearance, behavior, and content.
6. **Performance Optimized**: Designed to handle multiple 3D windows efficiently in a spatial environment.
